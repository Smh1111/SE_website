/* 

n case you are wondering, this is for global css like for example, some buttons could have the
same style, so you won't need to redefine it everytime when you wanna use the same button style in 
a different page

or maybe any style you are gonna be using in other pages
for example, aj visit likes tables so much, so let's say we have one stylesheet for that table
then 
    create table.css under the 'styles' folder, then u can use it everywhere!
*/


/* 
Maybe we could use some bootstrap or tailwind css components
and create css files from those frameworks under this folder


----- Then, import it in each page if we want some features from bootstrap or tailwind
